Design and implement a concurrent evaluation system in Java using the Callable 
interface, such that:
    - Each student’s evaluation runs in parallel
    - Each evaluation computes the total score from 5 exam sections
    - A student evaluation fails only for that student if invalid marks are detected
    - Other students’ evaluations continue unaffected
    
    
Input Format:
-------------
N → Number of students
N lines → Each line contains 5 space-separated integers (section marks)

Output Format:
--------------
For each student:
    - Print total score if evaluation succeeds
    - Print failure message if evaluation fails


Sample Input:
-------------
3
80 75 90 85 70
60 -10 70 80 90
88 92 77 85 90

Sample Output:
--------------
Student-1 Total = 400
Evaluation failed for Student-2: Invalid marks detected
Student-3 Total = 432
