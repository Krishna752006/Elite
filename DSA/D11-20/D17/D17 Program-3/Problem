You are designing a multithreaded output controller that prints values from 1 to N.

Four independent threads are created:
    ThreadA → prints "Hi"
    ThreadB → prints "Hello"
    ThreadC → prints "HiHello"
    ThreadD → prints the number itself

The threads must follow these rules:
    1. If the number is divisible by 3 only, print "Hi".
    2. If the number is divisible by 5 only, print "Hello".
    3. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "HiHello".
    4. Otherwise, print the number.
    5. Output must appear strictly in order from 1 to N.
    6. All four threads run concurrently.
    7. Proper synchronization must be implemented to avoid race conditions.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N.

Output Format:
--------------
Print a string array[].

Constraints:
• 1 <= n <= 10^4
 
Sample Input-1:
---------------
4

Sample Output-1:
----------------
1 2 Hi 4 


Sample Input-2:
---------------
15

Sample Output-2:
----------------
1 2 Hi 4 Hello Hi 7 8 Hi Hello 11 Hi 13 14 HiHello
