A smart factory has a central alarm system that coordinates three independent 
subsystems:
    - Thread A – Alarm Controller -> Activates a warning beep (prints 0).
    - Thread B – Even Sensor Unit -> Reports only even-numbered machine IDs.
    - Thread C – Odd Sensor Unit -> Reports only odd-numbered machine IDs.

The system must produce an alternating sequence:
0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 ...


The total length of the sequence must be 2n, where: n is the total number of 
machine IDs (from 1 to n). Each machine report must always be preceded by a 
warning beep (0).

Implement a class FactoryAlarmSystem that ensures proper synchronization between 
three threads so that: The alarm thread always prints 0, Then either the odd or 
even thread prints the next correct number. Continue this pattern until all 
numbers from 1 to n are printed
