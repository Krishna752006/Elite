You are given N customer orders that must be processed sequentially.
Design a Java multithreading application using the Callable interface only, 
with the following strict constraints:
    - There is exactly ONE Producer task
    - There is exactly ONE Consumer task
    - The number of orders (N) and the list of orders are global shared objects
    - The Producer and Consumer must not receive the orders directly
    - The Producer and Consumer must communicate only through a shared handoff object
    - There is NO buffer, queue, or collection used for intermediate storage

Each order must be processed in the following strict order:
Producer processes one order → Consumer processes the same order → then move to the next order

The Producer must wait until the Consumer finishes processing the current order.
The Consumer must wait until the Producer produces the next order.

Order Information: Each order contains the following details:

----------------------------------------

orderId			Unique order identifier
customerName	Name of the customer
productName		Product ordered
quantity		Number of items
pricePerUnit	Cost per item

----------------------------------------

Input Format:
