You are given a binary classification dataset and a single test sample.

Instead of building full decision trees, this problem uses a simplified and 
interpretable approach:
    Each feature independently acts as a binary decision stump 
    (a depth-1 decision tree).

A decision stump uses:
    - Only one feature
    - Only one split threshold
    - Exactly two partitions

🧠 What a Decision Stump Means Here
-----------------------------------
For a given feature f, the decision stump:
    - Selects a single threshold value
    - Splits the training data into two partitions:
        - Partition A: feature value ≤ threshold
        - Partition B: feature value > threshold
    - Uses Gini impurity to choose the best threshold
    - Predicts a class (0 or 1) for the test sample based on the majority class 
    of the matching partition

⚠️ Even though only one feature is used, the split is binary by definition, 
which is why two partitions always exist.

🧩 Task Description
-------------------
For each feature independently:
    - Treat the feature as a decision stump
    - Try all possible thresholds derived from training data
    - Compute the best threshold using Gini impurity
    - Predict the class of the test sample using this stump
    - Treat this prediction as one vote

All feature-level predictions are then combined using Random Forest–style
majority voting to produce the final predicted class.

🧵 Multithreading Requirement
-----------------------------
Each feature’s decision stump evaluation must run in parallel
Use one thread per feature
Implement concurrency using:
    - Callable
    - ExecutorService

📥 Input Format
---------------
N M
N lines: M feature values each (training data)
N class labels (0 or 1)
M feature values (test sample)

📤 Output Format
----------------
Feature Predictions: [p1, p2, ..., pM]
Final Predicted Class: X


Where:
------
pi is the prediction (0 or 1) from feature i
X is the majority-voted final class
In case of a tie, choose the smaller class label (0)
